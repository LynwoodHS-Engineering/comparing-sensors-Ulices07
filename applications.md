Ultrasonic sensors and limit switches can be used in a autonomous robotic system by ultrasonic sensors emitting off high-frequency sound waves and measuring distance with time from the echoes boucning off objects. It can be used for obstacle detection, to avoid collisions, and maintaining a path accuracy. Limit switches are contact sensors that physically detect when a specific location of a robot touches a surface. They can be used as stop points, overextension prevention, and for precise displacement. Both of theses sensors can allow a autonomous robotic system to sense immediate physical limits(limit switch) and the external environment(Ultrasonic sensor), making the robot more accurate, precise, reliable and safe.
