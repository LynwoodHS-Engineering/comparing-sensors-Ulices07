1. What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?
   The physical process that allows the Raspberry Pi to sense the environment is through the sensors where physical touch and distance is used to detect environmental conditons and then converted into electrical signals that the Raspberry Pi can interpret. 
2. What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?
   Some environment factors can be wind, dust, heat, water or humidity which can all affect the sensors in giving off improper signals. 
3. What role does coding play in this process?
   The coding plays a major role since it's what allows the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the sensors and process signals left off by the sensors. The coding also allows us to understand the signals by producing meanginful and understandable information back to us.
